CASTER-EDITION
==============

Repository for the wizard-centric roguelike CASTER EDITION.

This game is in the very early stages of development.

I am currently working on the spellcasting system. The game uses a procedural generation system, which can generate around 16,000 unique spell effects. 

The game aims to be unique by attempting to emulate one aspect of spellcasting that I feel is ignored in many games with spellcasting elements: the experimental nature of becoming a competent spellcaster. It would be difficult to explain in writing how exactly this is achieved, but I can gladly add an explanation later if enough interested parties ask me to. Of course, as the game reaches completion, the unique spellcasting mechanics will become more apparent.

I will warn the reader now, that the way I intend to make spellcasting in this game unique compared to other games may make the game frustrating to play. I believe this potential frustration is why most games don't attempt to make spellcasting experimental in nature, but its something I want to do for fun. 

Once the spellcasting system is complete, the game engine would be mostly finished as well, and the groundwork that is layed out for the procedural spell generation system might benefit someone else who wants a unique magic system in their game.
